Venice is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. Venice is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. The Bridge plays such an important part in Venice that studying the bridge can help us understand better the history and structure of Venice. Our project is mainly based on the book [Catalogo Veneziano – Ponti Santa Croce](https://studiosaor.com/product/catalogo-veneziano-ponti-santa-croce/) and [Catalogo Veneziano – Ponti San Polo](https://studiosaor.com/product/catalogo-veneziano-ponti-san-polo/), to build specific 3D models for these bridges and to create specific additional layers on the geographical information system.
